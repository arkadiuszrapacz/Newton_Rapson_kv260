## Newton-Raphson Algorithm Exercise with Xilinx Kria Kv260

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook guiding through an exercise on implementing the Newton-Raphson algorithm using Xilinx Kria Kv260, along with executable Python code.

### Contents:

- **Notebook**: `NRapson_Pynq.ipynb`
  - This Jupyter Notebook provides detailed instructions and code examples for implementing the Newton-Raphson algorithm on Xilinx Kria Kv260.
  - Images displayed during notebook compilation are located in the `img/` folder.
  
- **Simulation Data**: `simulation_output.csv`
  - Contains data from simulations conducted in the Vivado environment.
  
### Setup:

To run the notebook and execute the provided Python code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (recommended version: 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (numpy, matplotlib, etc.)

### Usage:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Newton_Raphson_kv260.git
```

Navigate into the cloned directory and launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
cd Newton_Raphson_kv260
jupyter notebook
```
Open NRapson_Pynq.ipynb from the Jupyter interface and follow the instructions within the notebook to explore and execute the algorithm.
